# Movie-Ticket-Booking-Website
## **Overview**
Online movie booking system is a web portal where you can book tickets in advance, know your show timing, watch movie trailers and read reviews for the same. The objective of the cinema reservation system is to provide the facility of booking movie tickets online.<br/><br/>
This project is aimed at developing a ticket reservation system for cinema halls. The ticket reservation system is an internet based application that can be accessed throughout the net and can be accessed by anyone who has an internet connection. This application will automate the reservation of tickets and enquiries about availability of the tickets. This application includes the login for the user by entering the username and password.<br/><br/>
This is one of the most important features of our system as it provides security. It is concluded by examining the existing system on the internet. There was a need to include such features included in the websites and that makes the website more trustworthy. This movie ticket reservation system handles login for the user and the admin that provides functions such as leaving the movies which are being showcased right now, the upcoming movies, booking the theatre hall, selecting the seat number, selecting the time for the movie and finally playing all the details before paying. The admin can add the theatre, the movie and the details of the movie. The admin can also schedule any movie in any hall at any time if it is available he can also view all the booking history.<br/><br/>
